I am a master student of cyber security at the <a href="http://cst.buaa.edu.cn/">School of Cyber Science and Technology</a> in <a href="https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University</a>, under the supervision of A/Prof. Ying Gao. I received my Bachelor's degree from <a href="https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University</a>.

My main research interests are **multiparty computation**, such as private set operations and oblivious transfer. I am also interested in zero-knowledge proof and lattice-based cryptography. Now I am looking for a Ph.D. position in cryptography.
