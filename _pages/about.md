I completed my Bachelor's degree in <a href="https://www.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University</a>, majoring in Information Management and Information System , and also pursued a minor in Mathematics.
I am an incoming Ph.D. Student in the <a href="https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/">Department of Electronic & Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://hkust.edu.hk/">HKUST</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://ling-pan.github.io/">Prof. Ling Pan</a>.
