I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/">Department of Electronic & Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://hkust.edu.hk/">HKUST</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://ling-pan.github.io/">Prof. Ling Pan</a>.

I received my Master’s degree from the <a href="https://ai.nju.edu.cn/main.htm">School of Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/homepage/">NJUNLP Group</a> at <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/">Nanjing University</a>, supervised by <a href="https://ai.nju.edu.cn/daixinyu/index.htm">Prof. Xinyu Dai</a>.

Before that, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in <a href="https://www.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University</a>, majoring in Information Management and Information System, and pursued a minor in Mathematics.

I am interested in topics such as Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, and GFlowNet, which will also be the focus of my efforts during my PhD studies.
